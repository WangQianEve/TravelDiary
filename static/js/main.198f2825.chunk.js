Because it says online there'd be a lot of people. We decided to enjoy the sunset in our hotel, and it turned out to be the most beautiful night we had through out the trip.

The wines are also fabulous!",weather:"Hot as other cities north to mediterranean.",cost:"Medium level. ",transportation:"This is probably the only part I dislike this city. You can only buy a one-time ticket with cash at certain stops! And you don't even know where they are! It's so inconvinient.

The one we took just suddenly decided to stop, so we have to walk the rest way OTL.",tips:["Don't buy anything from the vendors on the street...

We spent a whole day at a small local amusement part -- Tibidabo. And we went to the famous market for snacks.",foods:"Foods are pretty good here. My second favorite in these cities.
